# TemplateWebAstro

A boring, production-ready Astro **website template** — HTML-first, ~2 kB of
runtime JavaScript, and wired for marketing/SEO out of the box. Static pages
only: there is no blog.

Built on **Astro 7** + **Tailwind 4**. Everything is data-driven from a single
config file, so you change one place and metadata, structured data, the sitemap
and the web manifest all follow.

This starter is meant to disappear once you start building.

## Requirements

- **Node.js `>=22.12.0`** (Astro 7 requirement; odd-numbered releases like v23
  are not supported) — enforced via `engines` in `package.json`
- **pnpm** (the repo ships a `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`)

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

| Script              | Description                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm dev`          | Start the dev server                                   |
| `pnpm build`        | Production build to `dist/`                            |
| `pnpm preview`      | Preview the production build                           |
| `pnpm check`        | `astro check` (type + diagnostics)                     |
| `pnpm test`         | Vitest unit tests (`src/**/*.test.ts`)                 |
| `pnpm check:links`  | Internal link check over `dist/` (run after build)     |
| `pnpm check:jsonld` | JSON-LD check + summary over `dist/` (run after build) |
| `pnpm format`       | Prettier (`prettier-plugin-astro`) over the repo       |
| `pnpm format:check` | Formatting check (same as CI)                          |
| `pnpm check:setup`  | List template placeholders not yet filled in           |
| `pnpm images`       | Regenerate icons / OG image (`icons`, `og`, …)         |

> Set `url` in `src/content/site.ts` to your domain for correct canonical
> URLs, sitemap and JSON-LD. There is no `.env` and no build variable.

## Configuration as data

All site metadata lives in **`src/content/site.ts`** and flows into the Header,
Footer, SEO `<head>`, the JSON-LD graph, the sitemap filter and the web
manifest. There is no duplication — edit it once.

```ts
export const site = {
  name,
  tagline,
  description,
  locale,
  sameAs, // brand social profiles -> Organization.sameAs
  author, // -> Person (sameAs from author.socials)
  business, // optional: enables LocalBusiness + visible NAP (§4 MEO)
  contactFormUrl, // optional external form linked from /contact
  nav,
  footerNav, // secondary links (policy pages)
  seo: {
    ogImage,
    ogImageWidth,
    ogImageHeight,
    twitterSite,
    logo,
    robots,
    themeColor,
    noindexPaths,
  },
};
```

The site **origin** (`url`), the Cloudflare Web Analytics token
(`cloudflareBeaconToken`) and the Search Console code
(`seo.googleSiteVerification`) live here too — all three are public values, so
they are committed rather than kept in `.env`. Everything is configured by
editing files, which works from a phone. Read the origin via `Astro.site`.
Never put a real secret in this file.

## What's included

> Removing something? [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md) is the inventory: every
> feature, the files it actually lives in, a step-by-step removal recipe, and a
> report on the few couplings that make a clean removal harder than it looks.

**SEO & structured data**

- Per-page `<title>` (`Page | Site`), meta description, absolute canonical
- Open Graph + Twitter cards with an **absolute** image URL
- Connected JSON-LD `@graph` (`src/lib/seo/jsonld.ts`): Organization (or a
  Person publisher via `site.publisher`), WebSite, Person, WebPage + optional
  BreadcrumbList, all linked by `@id`; `pnpm check:jsonld` validates the built
  output and prints what it tells search engines
- Optional `LocalBusiness` node + visible NAP when `site.business` is set
- Rich `robots` defaults (`max-image-preview:large`, …); optional GSC meta

**Crawling**

- XML sitemap with a `noindex` filter synced to `site.seo.noindexPaths`
- `robots.txt` that allows crawling and points to the sitemap
- One URL shape (`trailingSlash: "never"`) across canonical and sitemap —
  enforced at the edge too (`html_handling: "drop-trailing-slash"` in
  `wrangler.jsonc` redirects `/about/` → `/about`)

**Content**

- Placeholder pages (home, about, contact, site policy, 404) filled in by the
  setup interview; FAQ via native `<details>`; visible NAP from
  `site.business`

**Performance & a11y**

- ~2 kB of runtime JS (link prefetching only — see [Runtime
  JavaScript](#runtime-javascript)); system fonts only — no web-font
  download, no font license to ship
- Long-term immutable caching for hashed assets (`public/_headers` →
  `/_astro/*`)
- Dark mode from the OS preference, no toggle and no flash of the wrong theme
- Semantic HTML; skip link; `aria-current` on active nav/crumb; JS-free mobile
  menu (`<details>`); `prefers-reduced-motion` respected
- Mobile-hardened: no horizontal page scroll at 320px, 44px touch targets on
  touch devices, `dvh` viewport units — see [Mobile](#mobile)

**Security headers**

- `public/_headers` ships `nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`,
  `Permissions-Policy` and HSTS on `/*`, plus a ready-to-uncomment CSP that
  matches this starter's default output

**CI & tests**

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `format:check` + `astro check` + `test` +
  `build` + `check:links` + `check:jsonld` on every push/PR (deploys stay on Cloudflare Workers
  Builds)
- Vitest specs cover the parts that break invisibly: JSON-LD `@id` wiring and
  `noindex` path matching
- `scripts/check-links.mjs` walks the built HTML and fails on dead internal
  links (no network, so it never goes flaky). It also verifies the `Sitemap:`
  URL in `robots.txt` — the one internal reference nothing else points at, so
  removing the sitemap integration can't silently leave a 404 behind

**PWA & analytics**

- `favicon.svg`/`.ico`, `apple-touch-icon`, 192/512 icons, dynamic
  `/site.webmanifest`
- Cookieless Cloudflare Web Analytics, injected only when a token is configured

## Mobile

Designed for 320px up, and checked by hand at 320px and 390px on the routes
this starter ships. Treat that as a starting point, not a guarantee: nothing in
CI measures viewport width, so new content can regress it. The rules below are
the mechanisms that make the property hold — they are what to check against.

Four rules keep it that way — break one and the phone layout goes with it:

1. **Nothing may widen the page.** Two layers: `overflow-wrap: anywhere` on
   the body for long URLs and identifiers (`anywhere`, not `break-word` — only
   `anywhere` shrinks min-content width, which is what a flex item is sized
   to); and `max-width: 100%` on embedded and replaced content, so an
   `<iframe>` (a map embed) or a wide inline `<svg>` cannot push the page out
   either. A wide table goes in its own `overflow-x: auto` box.

2. **Touch targets use the `tap-target` utility**, not ad-hoc padding. It sets
   24×24px everywhere (WCAG 2.2 AA, SC 2.5.8) and 44px under
   `@media (any-pointer: coarse)` — `any-pointer`, so an iPad with a keyboard
   or a touch laptop is treated as touch rather than as a mouse. It is for
   elements that could otherwise fall under the minimum; see CLAUDE.md rule 10
   for the three cases where it should _not_ be applied.

3. **Viewport height is `dvh`, never `vh`.** `100vh` on mobile browsers measures
   the viewport as if the URL bar were hidden, which leaves the footer below the
   fold on short pages.

4. **The mobile menu is a `<details>` disclosure** with `max-h-[75dvh]` and its
   own scroll, so a long nav stays usable on a short or landscape screen.

## Runtime JavaScript

One module, ~2.3 kB, on every page: Astro's link prefetcher
(`prefetch: { prefetchAll: true, defaultStrategy: "hover" }` in
`astro.config.mjs`). Nothing else ships JS — the mobile menu, the FAQ and dark
mode are all CSS/HTML.

Delete the `prefetch` block for a strictly zero-JS build, or keep the runtime
and opt individual links in with `data-astro-prefetch`.

## Styling (Tailwind 4)

There is no `tailwind.config.js`. Design tokens live in `src/styles/global.css`
inside an `@theme` block and become **both** CSS variables and utilities:

```css
@theme {
  --color-bg: #fbfbf9; /* -> bg-bg / text-bg / border-bg ... */
  --color-fg: #1a1a1a;
  --color-link: #0b3d91;
}
```

**Use only these tokens** (`bg-bg`, `text-fg`, `text-muted`, `border-border`,
`bg-surface`, `text-link`). A raw hex or a stock Tailwind color like
`text-gray-700` will not follow dark mode.

### Dark mode

Driven purely by `prefers-color-scheme`: the media query redefines the same
`--color-*` variables, so every utility re-themes at once. No toggle, no
`localStorage`, no inline script, and therefore no flash of the wrong theme.
`<meta name="theme-color">` is emitted twice (light/dark) from
`site.seo.themeColor` / `themeColorDark` — keep those in sync with `--color-bg`.

### Page copy

`@tailwindcss/typography` styles page copy via `<article class="prose">`, and its
`--tw-prose-*` variables are bound to the design tokens in `global.css` — so
long-form copy is exactly the same color as the rest of the site, in both
themes. Preflight replaces a hand-written reset.

## 日本語フォント

No web font is bundled: `--font-sans` in `global.css` is a system stack
(`Hiragino Sans`, `Noto Sans JP`, `Yu Gothic`, `Meiryo`, …), so there is
nothing to download and no font license to distribute. If typography must be
identical across devices, add a font through Astro's Fonts API (`fonts` in
`astro.config.mjs` + `<Font>` in `SEO.astro`) and ship its license file
(e.g. SIL OFL) next to the font files.

## Deploy (Cloudflare Workers Builds)

This starter deploys to **Cloudflare Workers static assets** through Git
integration — you push, and Cloudflare builds and deploys for you. No local
deploy step.

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Cloudflare dashboard → **Workers & Pages → Create → Connect to Git** → pick
   the repo (this folder is its own repo, so the build root is the repo root).
3. Build settings (defaults are fine):
   - **Build command:** `pnpm build`
   - **Deploy command:** `npx wrangler deploy` (production) /
     `npx wrangler versions upload` (other branches → preview URL on the PR)
4. No build variables are needed — everything comes from `site.ts`. Set
   `NODE_VERSION=22.17.1` only if the build picks the wrong Node.

`wrangler.jsonc` is the source of truth for the deploy: an **assets-only** Worker
(`assets.directory: ./dist`, `not_found_handling: "404-page"`, no `main`).
Everything else in it is commented with notes — uncomment as you add bindings,
cron, or SSR. Custom headers/redirects go in `public/_headers` /
`public/_redirects`. CI auth is automatic (no API token needed).

> `dist/` and `node_modules/` are gitignored — CI rebuilds them on every push.

## Notes

- **Icons** are generated from `public/favicon.svg`. Replace that mark and run
  `pnpm images icons` to regenerate the PNG/ICO set.
- **Security headers** live in `public/_headers` (that file _is_ the host-level
  config for Cloudflare static assets). Read the HSTS note before pointing a
  real domain at it, and uncomment the CSP once you know which third parties
  the site actually loads.
- **Analytics** is Cloudflare (cookieless) by default; swap
  `src/components/Cloudflare.astro` for GA4 if you prefer. Adding any third
  party means widening the CSP in `public/_headers`.
- **OG image** is one shared default. `pnpm images og <photo>` crops a photo to
  1200×630; `pnpm images og-text` draws the site name and tagline. Generating a
  per-page OG image at build time is deliberately _not_ included: doing it for
  Japanese titles needs a bundled CJK font (several MB in the repo), which
  costs more than it returns for most sites.
- **The sitemap lists the home page as `https://site`, not `https://site/`.**
  That is `@astrojs/sitemap` honouring `trailingSlash: "never"`, and the two
  are the same URL (RFC 3986 §6.2.3 — an empty path is equivalent to `/` for
  http/https). No action needed.
